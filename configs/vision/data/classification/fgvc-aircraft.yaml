# The dataset contains 10,000 images of aircraft, with 100 images for each of 100 different aircraft model variants, 
# most of which are airplanes. Aircraft models are organized in a three-levels hierarchy. The three levels, from finer 
# to coarser, are:
#   - variant, e.g. Boeing 737-700. A variant collapses all the models that are visually indistinguishable into one
#     class. The dataset comprises 100 different variants.
#   - family, e.g. Boeing 737. The dataset comprises 70 different families.
#   - manufacturer, e.g. Boeing. The dataset comprises 30 different manufacturers.
