# The Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) is an evolving collection of textural images in the wild, annotated with a
# series of human-centric attributes, inspired by the perceptual properties of textures. DTD is a texture database,
# consisting of 5640 images, organized according to a list of 47 terms (categories) inspired from human perception.
#   - There are 120 images for each category.
#   - Image sizes range between 300x300 and 640x640
#   - images contain at least 90% of the surface representing the category attribute.
#   - Train, validation and test, 40 images per class, for each split.
