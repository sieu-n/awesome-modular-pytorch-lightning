# The Food-101 is a challenging data set of
#   - 101 food categories
#   - 101â€™000 images.
#   - For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images.
# On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly
# in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length
# of 512 pixels.
